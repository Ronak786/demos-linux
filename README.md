The Linux API project
=====================
This project is a source code repository for instructors or expert programmers
who want to explore the Linux C/C++ API.
It has about 600 examples (as of 01/2013) I found are useful in explaining the Linux API.
The idea is to provide a good coverage of all major features and to resolve disputes
about exactly how a certain API works.

Topics covered by the examples
------------------------------
* Multi-threading
* Multi-processing
* Locking
* Calling system calls without C
* Performance
* Many more...

Contributing
------------
This project needs help! fork me and commit!
Just open a github account, modify and add examples and ask me to commit...
A lot of the code is documented but some of it is not. More documentation would be welcome.
I would give attribution to whomever contributes.

Licensing
---------
Code is licensed GPL3 and I hold the copyright unless explicity stolen as attributed in the source code.
I encourage to use people to use this source code in courses for instruction.
Please give me some credit for it if you do wind up using it and consider sending dropping
me a note about it so I could feel good...

Using it
--------
* you need python on your machine:
	try:
		python --version
	if python is missing then:
		for deb based distributions (debian, ubuntu, ...) do:
			sudo apt-get install python
		for rpm based distributions (fedora, redhat, centos,...) do:
			sudo yum install python
* clone the examples:
		git clone git@github.com:veltzer/linuxapi.git
* cd into it:
		cd linuxapi
* install the missing packages and headers needed to compile and run this project
		./scripts/ubuntu_install.py
* compile:
		make
* some of the examples may not compile for you because of missing libraries. Don't worry:
	you can build each specific example by issuing:
		make src/examples/performance/cache_misser.elf
	the name of the elf binary is the same as the example source code with .elf instead of
	.[c|cc].
	You must be at the root of the project to issue the 'make' command.
* the most important part: tweak the examples, try to prove me (my comments) wrong, have fun!
