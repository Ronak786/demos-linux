/*
* This demos shows how to use sendfile(2) to avoid copy to/from user space.
* The demo itself is just a simple version of cp(1)
*
* It seems that this demo doesn't run properly on 2.6.32 and should run
* on 2.6.33 or later.
* On 2.6.38 it works well.
*
* Notes:
* - we send the data page by page and call sendfile(2) many times. This could
* be avoided using fstat(2) after the open of the input file and sending the
* entire content at once. On the other hand this could cause performance issues.
* This needs to be checked. In any case the buffer of a single page size
* as is used here seems too small for good performace on todays systems.
