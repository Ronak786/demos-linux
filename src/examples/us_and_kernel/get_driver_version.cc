* This example shows how to extract the version number from a "ko" (kernel object)
* file...
*
* BEWARE: This code DOES NOT WORK!!!
*
* This code has led me to the conclusion that modinfo does not use dlopen to get
* the information from the .ko files but rather mmaps them directly and uses
* 'man 5 elf' to find the format of the executable file. Do NOT use this code - it
* will crash your program...
*
* How to fix this ?
* Get your hands on the source code of 'modinfo' and copy the relevant parts here.
* (publish this in a blog for the interested parties...)
