/*
 * This example explores compiler builtins like:
 * __FILE__, __LINE__, __func__, __FUNCTION__, __PRETTY_FUNCTION__
 * Which can be used in order to produce better error/logging/debug/warning
 *messages.
 *
 * Notice that if you put the prints, even in an inline function, then you get
 *the data
 * for the ** inline function ** which is the calee and not for the caller. This
 *is
 * probably not what you want. A way to solve this is to use a macro (also
 *demonstrated
 * below).
 *
 * Notice that __FILE__ and __LINE__ are different from __func__, __FUNCTION__
 *and
 * __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ in that the former are supplied by the pre processor and
 *the latter
 * are supplied by the compiler. This distinction however is not very important.
 *
 * A frequently asked question here is how to indent the printing to match the
 *level
 * of stack at which the printing occurs. This is not very easy as there is no
 *variable
 * "stacklevel" or some such which indicated the stack level and can facilitate
 *this.
 * However, you can use function entry and exit handlers, either explicit or
 *implicit,
 * to facilitate this.
