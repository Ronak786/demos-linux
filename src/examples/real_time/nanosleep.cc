/*
*	This is an example showing how to sleep for very short periods of
*	time and proves that it is indeed so...
*
*	As you can see there is a diff of about 100 micro between the time
*	to sleep and the real time slept. This is MUCH less than the HZ
*	value for linux (ranging from 100HZ to 1000HZ which yields 10000 micro
*	to 1000 micro which are much bigger values.
*
*	In order to actually prove this there is still a need to split this
*	program into two threads the higher priority of which runs this
*	code and the lower keeping the CPU occupied all the time (by doing
*	some calculation). According to expection the difference from the
*	expected sleep time should remain about 100 micro.
*
*	Where does this 100 micro come from ? The answer lies in the accuracy
*	of the interrupt handler, it's clock and the time to reschedule...
*	The real time patch to the kernel can reduce this further...
*
*	Take note that nanosleep does not involve signals and so is 'signal
*	safe' and on machines with a good rtc will use it. read more in the
*	documentation.
*
* EXTRA_LIBS=-lcpufreq
*
* TODO:
* - it seems that this example does not work well in Ubuntu since the
*	cpu_freq function returns 0 as the frequency of the cpu. Find out why
*	and fix the example.
* - use usleep and sleep also and compare the results to those of nanosleep.
