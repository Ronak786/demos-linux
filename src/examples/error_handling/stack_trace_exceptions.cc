/*
* This is a C++ example of how to create exceptions which contain a stack trace
* of where they occured. This uses the backtrace function.
* Notes:
* - if you compile with -O2 you get less stack frames in the output
* since some of the functions are inlined by the compiler.
* - I added __attribute__((noinline)) to prevent the inlining to see more
* stack traces. This made the stack frames visible but without the names.
* If you want to see all stack frames then remove all optimization flags at
* compile time.
* - we drop two stack frames that don't interest
* us (two functions that are above the 'main' function).
* - yet another issue is C++ name mangling. You can either do that on the command
* line using the 'c++filt(1)' tool or in the code by using the C++ library.
* - the '-rdynamic' flag is needed if the 'backtrace_symbols' function is to
* work and return symbols to you.
*
* EXTRA_LIBS=-rdynamic
*
* TODO:
* - show how to see the two "nameless" stack frames in the middle (they are not currently seen).
* - bring back the c++ demangling code (it was removed because it was crashing the app).
