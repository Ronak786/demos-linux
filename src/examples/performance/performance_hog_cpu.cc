/*
 * This is a simple example that spends lots of time in a function.
 * You can watch this with 'sudo perf top' and enter the function with 's'.
 *
 * make sure you compile this with debug info if you want to see
 * perf annotate the machine code with your code.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - you need the sudo since perf works by hardware events and support for them in the kernel.
 * - you can avoid root with:
 *	Consider tweaking /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid:
 *	-1 - Not paranoid at all
 *	0 - Disallow raw tracepoint access for unpriv
 *	1 - Disallow cpu events for unpriv
 *	2 - Disallow kernel profiling for unpriv
 * - if you strip the executable you will not get the function names.
 *
 * This is to make sure I can see annotation.
