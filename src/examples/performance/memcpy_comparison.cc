 * This example compares memcpy(3) to copy by loop...
 * As you can see memcpy is faster since it uses a specialized machine instruction to do the copying.
 * See the disassembly for more details.
 * If you uncomment the rand() code you will find that memcpy does not give you any slack: it does NOT
 * check the arguments passed to it for sanity. This is part of the philosophy of the GNU/Linux system.
 * The idea is that system programmers can take care of themselves and the APIs should be as fast
 * as possible to cater for good programmers.
