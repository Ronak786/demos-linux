/*
* This example demostrates how processes become zombies in Linux...
*
* How does a process become a zombie in Linux ?
* - The parent creates the process.
* - The process ends.
* - The parent does not collect the processes return code using one of
* the wait(2) family of functions.
*
* Note that if the parent dies then init(1) will actually serve as the
* new parent for the child process (sort of adoption) and will clear the
* child. So a zombie is always a process with a live parent (unless there
* is a bug in init(1), ofcourse...).
*
* We show the status of the child in this application in two ways:
* - using the ps command.
* - using the libproc library.
* - catting
*
* From the command line you can also see info about zombies using:
* - ps(1) (done in this example).
* - catting files from the /proc folder (done in two ways in this example).
* - top(1)
*
* EXTRA_LIBS=-lproc
