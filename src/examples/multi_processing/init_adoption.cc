* This example demostrates what happens when a processes father dies...
*
* - Notice that the getppid() function returns different values because of the
* adoption by the init(1) process.
* - This example forks twice to show that there is no "grandparent adoption" and
* that grandparents are not interested in their grandchildren.
* - We need to wait a little to make sure that the parent dies - there is no synchroneous
* way to get this info as far as I know...
*
* TODO:
* - investigate how it is exactly that init does the things he does (is it the kernel as I
* suspect that latches processes under the init process ?!? - if so, find the place
* in the kernel that does this...).
