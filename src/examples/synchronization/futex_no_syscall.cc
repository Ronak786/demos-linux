/*
* This example creates a pthread_mutex which is a futex, grabs it and releases
* it. Run it with strace to see that it does not call any system call.
*
* Notes:
* - there is no syscall involved with this futex AT ALL! This is because this futex is private
*	and therefore not robust. Futexes can be robust in which case you need to tell that at creation
*	which will notify the kernel about this futex.
*	by default futexes are private.
*	This means that even creation of futexes is cheap.
*
* Problem:
* - even if I create a process shared mutex the pthread library calls no syscall at mutex_init time!!!
*	How can this be if the futex is robust?!? investigate...
*
* EXTRA_LIBS=-lpthread
*
* TODO:
* - make this example strace itself...
