* This is a demo to show how sync_synchronize() is implemented...
* You should see the __sync_synchronize which is a machine memory barrier
* translated to a "lock orl" instruction in assembly which is an instruction
* to the core you are running on to stop reading from the cache.
* So you should see one instruction in the disassembly of this code.
* And indeed this is what we see.
*
* Take note that this is a also a compiler barrier. It prevents the compiler
* from reordering around this code. You don't see any assembly emitted for
* that since a compiler barrier is only a compile time instruction about
* code emittion.
