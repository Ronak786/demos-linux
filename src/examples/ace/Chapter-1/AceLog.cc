 * This is a basic example of using ACE_DEBUG and ACE_TRACE.

 * Notes:
 * - the ACE_NTRACE macro controls whether trace does anything special or
 * not.
 * - the "%I" ACE_DEBUG modifier adds indentation level which matches the trace
 * level.
 * - you have to put your own newline at the end of ACE_DEBUG messages.
