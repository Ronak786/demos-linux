- do example that investigates loosing signals.
	have a child/parent fork process where the child
	sends a bunch of signals at a high rate to the parent
	the parent delays handling the signals either with
	sleeping inside it's signal handlers or using
	sigprocmask.
	The parent will count the number of signals it got
	until the child died.
	The child will print the number of signals it send
	to the parent.
	Show that for old/standard signals the number are
	different while for new/RT linux signals
	the number are the same.
- improve the signalfd example and show show to do signal handling in conjunction with io.
- demonstrate the blocking of signals via sigprocmask.
- demonstrate the use of sigsuspend.
- demonstrate the use of sigwait.
- demonstrate the use of sigwaitinfo.
- demonstrate the use of real time signals (receiving and sending via sigqueue).
- demonstrate the use of sigpending(2).
- demonstrate the use of sigaltstack(2)
- many more signal functions: see man -k sig | grep 2
- demonstrate the use of pause to implement async io with signals.
