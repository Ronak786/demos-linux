/*
	this is an example of a loop that gcc cannot optimize away...
	Consider the question why ? Doesn't gcc simulate your code
	in order to optimize it away ? The answer is that it does
	not simulate your code but rather understand the underlying
	construct to deduce what you are doing and use a predefined
	set of formulas to precalculate the result...

	You can see that indeed it is not optimized when you disassemble
	the code.

	Compare the second loop to the first.
