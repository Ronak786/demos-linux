/*
 * This example explores the use of references.
 *
 * Things to notice:
 * - the reference is not even stored in it's own place on the stack, or anywhere.
 *	It is a compile time figment of the imagination.
 * - when changing the reference you change the actual value, much like you would do
 *	with a pointer. The syntax is different though. Instead of doing *p=7 you simply
 *	do p=7.
 * - Changing the reference DOES NOT change what value of the reference (it s a pointer
 *	after all) but rather what the reference is pointing to.
