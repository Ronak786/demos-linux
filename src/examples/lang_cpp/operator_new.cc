/*
 * This explores how to override the new operator for the entire C++ environment.
 * Both for regular allocation and for arrays....
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 * the "void operator delete(void* p)" takes care of deleting
 * both "void* operator new(const unsigned int size)" and
 * "void* operator new(const unsigned int size,const unsigned int type)" allocated
 * objects. You cannot pass hints to the delete operator and so one delete operator
 * takes care of all hinted operators. The same goes for the array case.
 *
 * if you do not declare an array allocation then:
 * - for regular/non hinted array allocation the regular C++ array
 * allocator will be used.
 * - for non regular/hinted array allocation you'll get a compile time error
 * (missing an allocation opeator of the type you desire...).
 *
 * in order to activate delete[] you *MUST* write you release code as:
 * delete [] arr2. doing "delete my_array" or an array allocated as
 * "myarray=new obj[x]" will result in the regular delete(void*) operator
 * being called.
