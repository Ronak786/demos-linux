 * This is a demo of how to write a function for which the user must check the

 *
 * There are many more attributes that you can attach to functions in order to
 * get more checks from the compiler at compile time and get better code. Check
 * 'info gcc' for more details.
 *
 * Note that you can attach the "unused" attribute to variables as below
 * to avoid warnings about them being unused when you really don't want
 * to check the return value.

// this is how to use unused in a function declaration...
// this is the right place to put the __attribute__...
int add(int a, int b) __attribute__((warn_unused_result));

int add(int a, int b) {

	#pragma GCC diagnostic push
	#pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wunused-result"
	add(5, 6);
	#pragma GCC diagnostic pop
	// another way to ignore the requirement to use the result is to put it
