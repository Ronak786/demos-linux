/*
 * This application demonstrates the use of anonymous memory mappings to get
 * memory from the operating system.
 * Notes:
 * - memory returned from mmap is on a page boundry (see the assert).
 * - you can set your own protection on the pages.
 * - you can even set your own address instead of the null that we pass -
 * although there are issues with that.
 * - you can use the memory like you would use any other.
 * - if you want to avoid page faults here are three options:
 *	- touch the memory (bzero, memset, ....).
 *	- mlock
 *	- MAP_POPULATE
 * - later you can use this memory as shared memory with another process.
 *
 * EXTRA_LIBS=-lproc
