 * This example shows how to use the cleanup framework provided by the standard C library
 * notice that cleanup functions are called in reverse order of their registration
 *
 * Notes:
 * - the same function can be registered multiple times (with atexit or on_exit).
 * - the limit to number of registrations seems to be very high (millions ?!?).
 * - the API to on_exit seems to be a bit better since it allows to pass a pointer
 * and get the exit code which atexit does not allow.
 * - on the other hand the documentation states that atexit is preffered on Linux.
