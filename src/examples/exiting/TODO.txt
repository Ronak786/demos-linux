- show how to exit cleanly by breaking out of syscalls in other threads
	(siginterrupt(2)).
- show how to cleanup after threads.
- show how to intercept signals (SIGSEGV?) and perform some cleanup code.
- show C++ patterns for doing cleanup code.

- show a multi-threaded program and show that _exit(2) (the real one,
	not the glibc wrapper) and exit_group(2) do different things.
