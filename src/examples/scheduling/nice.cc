 * This examples shows the effect of the nice scheduling system.

 * It binds the process to a single core (for multi core systems).
 * It then forks two versions of heavy work each with a different nice level.
 * Then you can compare the work done by each of these.
 *
 * References:
 * man 2 nice

 * TODO:
 * - make the printing look nicer so that it would be obvious that the child
 * and the parent are running in different speeds.
