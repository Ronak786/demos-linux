/*
* An example of doing a loop and telling the compiler that a register should be
* involved.
* We will also print the register.
* How did we know what register the compiler used as the iterator of the loop? We
* disassembled the code.
* Note that removing the 'volatile' will cause the code to stop running correctly.
* (need to look at the disassembly to find out exactly why...).
* Here is a funny side note: if you remove the printf for i then the compiler
* will not optimize the loop away because of the printing of the register. But
* you will see that the value of the register does go down from 100 to 1 (not
* from 99 to 0 mind you). The compiler thinks that its better to count down
* than up because of the shorter "compare to zero" at the end of the loop.
