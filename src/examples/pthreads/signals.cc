 * This example explores the relations between threads and signal handling.
 * If we have more than one thread which thread will be used to handle a signal?
 *
 * Notes:
 * - you can signal threads from the command line using kill(1). You just have
 * to know the thread id.
 * - If you register a signal handler from the main thread before the creation of
 * the child threads then they too will have the signal handler installed.
 * - You can also do it after the child threads are created.
 * - What if a signal is registered by the child? Same. All threads get the handler.
