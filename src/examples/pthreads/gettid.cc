	This demo explored gettid() and getpid() issues on linux
	This demo shows that:
	- for the main thread (the one going from the main function) the thread id
	is the same as the process id.
	- for other threads the process id is the same but the thread id is different.
	- pthread_self() is different than all of the above (some opaque value).
	- there is no wrapper function in libc for gettid. I use a wrapper
	here that I defined myself in "us_helper.hh". Check it out. You can either
	use that or use some framework which gives you wrappers.
