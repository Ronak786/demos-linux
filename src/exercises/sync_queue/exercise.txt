Use STL linked list + pthread cond + pthread mutex to create
a syncronzied message queue to be used to pass messaged between
threads.

The two main methods: get, put

if you "get" when the queue is empty you go to sleep
"put" never goes to sleep and only adds to the queue.

Have a nice Template OO wrapper for this.

	SyncQueue<MyMessageType>* q=new SyncQueue<MyMessageType>();
