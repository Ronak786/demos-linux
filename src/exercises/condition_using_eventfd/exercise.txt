Implement the following pthread functions using eventfd(2):
	pthread_cond_init (3) - operations on conditions
	pthread_cond_destroy (3) - operations on conditions
	pthread_cond_broadcast (3) - operations on conditions
	pthread_cond_signal (3) - operations on conditions
	pthread_cond_wait (3) - operations on conditions
Bonus: suggest a way to improve the pthread_conf API to enable to signal
	a specific thread. Implement your enhancement. Demonstrate using
	a fine grained readers/writer lock.
