A high performance echo server written in C on Linux
====================================================
This exercise requires you to build a multi-client echo
server in C under linux.

Design:
The design of the server is based on the epoll(2) subsystem.
So you would use just one thread to serve multiple clients.
Your server would receive a service directory. Whenever a request for
a file from the service directory comes along then it would just serve
the content of that file.
The server would still service *MULTIPLE* clients simultaneously but
*IT WOULD* not be multi-threaded.

Testing that it works:
You would test your server by connecting to it using multiple telnet
session.

Handling errors:
Remmember to handle errors from *ALL* system calls (you never know when
one of them breaks).

Bonus:
- have timeouts for threads.
