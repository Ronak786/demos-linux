 * This is the first child
 * It closes it's own standrad output (which it inherited from the parent - usually
 * the console where the parent was run).
 * It then closes the side of the pipe that it is not going to use (the read side [0]).
 * This is done so that the other side will get SIGPIPE and eof when all is done.
 * It then duplicates the side of the pipe that it will use (the write side [1]) to its
 * standard output (that it will give to it's children in case of exec).
 * It executes ls which prints to the pipes write side.
 * When ls dies this process dies.
 * The line after execl doesn't get executed...
