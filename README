The Linux API project
=====================
This project is a source code repository for instructors or expert programmers
who want to explore the Linux C/C++ API.

It has a few hundred examples I found are useful in explaining the Linux API.

This project needs help! fork me and commit!

More documentation to come...

How do you use it? pull and compile using "make". Explore the examples. They are full of comments.
Tweak them. Have fun.
