- format all user space code right and do the check as formatting
	and then checking for no diff.

- get more examples from http://www.linuxprogrammingblog.com/

- write slides about room for optimization.
- write slides about allocating memory fast.
- write slides about patterns.
	start with the proactor pattern.
- write slides about restrict.
- padding of structures and aligning structures in gcc and intel.

slides about the intel compiler:
- do some slides about how to install the intel compiler.
- comparison of intel compiler to gcc
	performance examples.
- compatibility of the intel compiler to the gcc compiler
	- do example with C++ compatibility for the intel compiler.

precompiled headers:
	- do standalone gcc precompiled headers example in linuxapi.
	- do standalone intel precompiled headers example in linuxapi.
	- make the linuxapi package itself use precompiled headers.
- mouse device driver example.
- executable library example.
	(still not fully done although getting there).
- make a script to update the README file with stats of this project.
	(python preprocessor?). Run it whenever we release a version.
- find two spaces in a row.
- add a test to make sure that all source files begin with my header.
- make sure EXIT_SUCCESS is everywhere (how do I test this?!?).
