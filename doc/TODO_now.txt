examples:
- finish the multi threaded file copy example.
- compare the performance of all of my copy implementations using
	some kind of script.
- web server using splice.
- do networking select example.
- do tee using select example.
- precompiled headers:
	- do standalone gcc precompiled headers example in linuxapi.
	- do standalone intel precompiled headers example in linuxapi.
	- make the linuxapi package itself use precompiled headers.
- mouse device driver example.
- executable library example.
	(still not fully done although getting there).

- get more examples from http://www.linuxprogrammingblog.com/

build system:
- make the linuxapi project compile for new ubuntu users
	(by default without intel compiler, without papi and without fcmp).
- see that there are no warnings in eclipse.
	(run the eclipse c++ validation tool out of eclipse).
- make a script to update the README.md file with real stats of this project.
	(python preprocessor?). Run it whenever we release a version.
- make sure EXIT_SUCCESS is everywhere (how do I test this?!?).
