types of context switches and how to avoid them:
	1. calling a syscall
		a. avoid it.
		b. call better APIs (readv vs read).
		c. do smarter io (multiplexing and more).
		d. use futexes instead of semaphores and any APIS
			which reduce context switches.
	2. schedulingq/pre-emption context switches
		a. increase your priority or decreate your opponents.
		b. tune the linux scehduler (/proc/sys/kernel/sched_*)
		c. compile the linux kernel to server mode pre-emption.
	3. interrupts from hardware
		a. affine them to some other CPU.
		b. mitigate them.
