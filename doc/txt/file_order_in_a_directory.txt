files are stored in directories in some "natural" order which is the order
at which the underlying file system orders them.

different file systems have different natural orders.

simple file systems (like FAT) have a natural order which
matches the order in which you created the files in the directory.

When you do something like "echo *" or "ls" in a folder both the shell (first example)
or ls (second example) sort the files for you so you don't see the natural order.

When you copy files recusivly (cp -r) you copy in "natural" order since cp iterates
recursivly in natural order.

If you want to see the natural order use "ls -f".

Why would you care about all this?
Well - some mp3 mplayer are based on FAT file systems and display and play tracks
in natural order which is the FAT natural order. This means that you have to copy
the files in the right order.
