This is a TODO list for the linuxapi website
============================================
The idea is to have a web site that discusses the C linuxapi.
It should show the code samples from the git (or parts of them with references to the full example).
You could seach for examples according to tags too.
And ofcourse we need a discussion forum about each example.
And we need to host it on a google webapp or amazon machine.
