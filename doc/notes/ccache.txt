This is a document describing ccache that should be turned into a ccache presentation
=====================================================================================

notes:
- ccache cannot be used for linking. Just compilation. If you use it for linking
it will just call the linker/compiler. So a single command like:
	ccache gcc file.cc -o file.out
will NOT use ccache. ccache WILL NOT break the command into compilation and then
link phase and use the cache for the first of these nor does it cache link results.
