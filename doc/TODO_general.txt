c++ userspace and kernel stuff:
===============================
- find out why rdtsc doesnt work well on my multi core machine.
	fix it.
- do an example of libevent in linux.

- find a general solution for storing TODO items inside source files.
	the idea is that I will be able to extract all of those
	todo items easily and track them.
	Each TODO item should be able to be a multi lined item.
	I should be able to identify them easily.
	I should be able to put them into both types of comments
		(// and /* ... */)
	I should be able to put them into the begining and in the
	middle of the code.
	I should know when the TODO item ends.
  convert all TODO items to this type of notation.

- write some few stream examples.
- finish the slides about the streams library in glibc.
	add write and read buffering.
- add another way of program disassembling itself:
	use __file__ for the program to compile itself using
	gcc only to assembly and dump the output to the screen.
	We have to find a way to pass the flags so that we would know how to compile.
	create an example specifically for disassembly.
