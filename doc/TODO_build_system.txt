TODO list for the build system for these examples:
==================================================
- add checkpatch.pl on the standalone modules too...
- my build system does not work well for kernel samples with -j.
	try to build all (make clean and then make -j 4) and you
	will see the errors.
	fix this.
- make the standalone folder examples use ccache too (as derived from
	the main makefile).
- make the kernel use ccache too?!?
- compile all the examples on a 64 bit system (they do not compile).
	This will probably require me to setup a 64bit virtual
	machine using virtual box or some such.
